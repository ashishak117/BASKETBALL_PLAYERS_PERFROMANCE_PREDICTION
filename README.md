# BASKETBALL_PLAYERS_PERFROMANCE_PREDICTION
This project predicts BasketBall player performance metrics, such as total points, based on various player statistics.  primary machine learning model algorithms are implemented to achieve high prediction accuracy. 
Models and Performance
Linear Regression

Best R² Score: 0.973
A baseline model for regression, demonstrating strong predictive power.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

R² Score: 0.92
A non-parametric model that predicts based on the proximity of data points.
Decision Tree

R² Score: 0.955
A model that splits the dataset into branches to make predictions, achieving solid accuracy.
Random Forest

R² Score: 0.977
An ensemble model of decision trees that improves prediction accuracy over a single decision tree.
